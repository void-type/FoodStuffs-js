# FoodStuffs

This is Node.js application that stores recipes. It is similar to the asp.net variant of the same name. 

## Technologies

This application was built on Node.js, Express, and uses the Jade templating engine and stores to a local MongoDb.

The future goal is to implement Angular for change saving and other features, possibly adding multi-user support and a news feed for sharing recipes.

1. Install Node.js
2. Open terminal and cd to directroy that has package.json
